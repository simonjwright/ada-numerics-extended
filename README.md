## GNAT Math Extensions ##

The purpose of this project is to provide additional matrix capabilities beyond those defined in the Standard Library (Annex G of the ARM). The implementations, which are only for GNAT, are in the form of bindings to the LAPACK and BLAS libraries which are widely available if not already provided on all operating systems.

## Prerequisites ##

BLAS and LAPACK are required to be on the library lookup path (so that the linker switches `-llapack -lblas` find them).

On macOS, they are part of the vecLib framework (though, as of Monterey 12.3.1, LAPACK is still at version 3.2.1).

On Debian, check out `liblapack3`, `libblas3`.

On Windows, check out LAPACK for Windows at http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/

Installation
============

The software is provided in a directory structure where

   `src/`  contains the library code
   `test/` contains unit tests.

Execute "make". This will build a static library for use in your own programs, and a test program (test/tests) using AUnit.

In order to use the library within your own code, you need to use a GPR referencing the extensions' GPR, `gnat_math_extensions`. You can

* say `with "gnat_math_extensions";` and include `/where/ever/gnat_math_extensions` in your `GPR_PROJECTS_PATH` environment variable; or

* say `with "/where/ever/gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD/gnat_math_extensions";` (this path can be relative, if you like).

* install with your compiler by saying `make install` (perhaps more likely, `sudo make install`). You can then say `with "gnat_math_extensions";`

Testing
=======

Unit tests are based on AUnit version 3, which is expected to be installed.
