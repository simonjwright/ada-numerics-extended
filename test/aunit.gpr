--  This GNAT Project file calls up the AUnit (v3) source code,
--  selecting those parts that are appropriate to a hosted test
--  environment.
--
--  The source tree used defaults to a read-only SVN checkout from
--  http://svn.eu.adacore.com/anonsvn/US/trunk/AUnit, in $HOME/$AUNIT
--  (default AUnit-svn).
--
--  Why not install AUnit? Because the installation process really
--  only works if you only have one GNAT compiler. If you need to try
--  out several different versions, it gets hard to managed installed
--  libraries.
