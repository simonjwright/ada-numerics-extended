This is the change log for the Ada 2005 Math Extensions project
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnat-math-extn/) on SourceForge.

2012mmdd

        The GNAT Project file is now in the top directory of the
        distribution.

        The tests expect AUnit to be installed.

        Different releases of LAPACK may alter the sign of
        eigenvectors returned by the generalized eigensystem code
        (remember that the generalized eigensystem is Av = lBv, where
        l is an eigenvalue and v is the corresponding
        eigenvector). This only affected the tests.

        Testing on Debian 6 required an increase in the test limit for
        complex general eigenvalues tests for Float.

        In GNAT GPL 2012 and GCC 4.7, LAPACK and BLAS are no longer
        used, and therefore aren't provided as part of GNAT on
        platforms where they aren't natively available. This package
        requires LAPACK and BLAS to be installed (it links with
        "-llapack -lblas").

20110320

        An additional overloaded procedure Eigensystem returns the
        generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a pair of
        non-hermitian complex matrices.

        The program Test_Extensions is renamed to Demo_Extensions, and
        includes a demonstration of the real generalized eigensystem
        code.

        The library project file is renamed src/gnat_math_extensions.gpr.

20101223

        The package is renamed to Ada_Numerics.Generic_Arrays.

        An additional overloaded procedure Eigensystem returns the
        generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a pair of
        non-symmetric real matrices.

20100901

        An additional overloaded procedure Eigensystem returns the
        complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a non-symmetric real
        matrix.

20100818

        An additional overloaded function Eigenvalues returns the
        complex eigenvalues of a non-symmetric real matrix.

        Procedure Eigensystem returns the complex eigenvalues and
        eigenvectors of a non-hermitian complex matrix.

        The package is renamed to Ada.Numerics.Generic_Arrays.

20100810

        This is the first release.

        There is only one operation: the function Eigenvalues returns
        the eigenvalues of a general (non-Hermitian) complex matrix.
