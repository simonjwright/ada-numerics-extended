This is the change log for the Ada 2005 Math Extensions project
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnat-math-extn/) on SourceForge.

20yymmdd

        The program Test_Extensions is renamed to Demo_Extensions, and
        includes demonstration of the real generalized eigensystem
        code.

20101223

        The package is renamed to Ada_Numerics.Generic_Arrays.

        An additional overloaded procedure Eigensystem returns the
        generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a pair of
        non-symmetric real matrices.

20100901

        An additional overloaded procedure Eigensystem returns the
        complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a non-symmetric real
        matrix.

20100818

        An additional overloaded function Eigenvalues returns the
        complex eigenvalues of a non-symmetric real matrix.

        Procedure Eigensystem returns the complex eigenvalues and
        eigenvectors of a non-hermitian complex matrix.

        The package is renamed to Ada.Numerics.Generic_Arrays.

20100810

        This is the first release.

        There is only one operation: the function Eigenvalues returns
        the eigenvalues of a general (non-Hermitian) complex matrix.
