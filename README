This is the README file for distributions of the Ada 2005 Math
Extensions project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnat-math-extn/)
on SourceForge.

The purpose of this project is to provide additional matrix
capabilities beyond those defined in the Standard Library (Annex G of
the ARM). The implementations, which are only for GNAT, are in the
form of bindings to the LAPACK and BLAS libraries which are widely
available if not already provided on all operating systems.

Prerequisites
=============

BLAS and LAPACK are required to be on the library lookup path (so that
the linker switches "-llapack -lblas" find them).

On macOS, they are part of the vecLib framework (though, as of Sierra
10.12.4, LAPACK is still at version 3.2.1).

On Debian, check out liblapack3, libblas3.

On Windows, check out LAPACK for Windows at
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/

Installation
============

The software unpacks into a directory structure of the form

gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD
   /src  contains the library code
   /test contains unit tests.

Execute "make". This will build a static library for use in your own
programs, and a test program (test/tests) using AUnit.

In order to use the library within your own code, you need to use a
GPR referencing the extensions' GPR, "gnat_math_extensions". You can

* say 'with "gnat_math_extensions";' and include
  /where/ever/gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD in your ADA_PROJECTS_PATH
  environment variable; or

* say 'with "/where/ever/gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD/gnat_math_extensions";'
  (this path can be relative, if you like).

* install with your compiler by saying 'make install'. You can then
  say 'with "gnat_math_extensions";'

Testing
=======

Unit tests are based on AUnit version 3 (part of GNAT GPL), which is
expected to be installed.
