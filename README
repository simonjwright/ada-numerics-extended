This is the README file for distributions of the Ada 2005 Math
Extensions project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnat-math-extn/)
on SourceForge.

The purpose of this project is to provide additional matrix
capabilities beyond those defined in the Standard Library (Annex G of
the ARM). The implementations, which are only for GNAT, are in the
form of bindings to the LAPACK and BLAS libraries which are widely
available if not already provided on all operating systems, and in any
case form part of GNAT GPL.

Installation
============

The software unpacks into a directory structure of the form

gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD
   /src  contains the library code
   /test contains an installation verification program and unit tests.

Go to the test/ directory. If on a Unix-based system, run
   $ gnatmake -p -P demo_extensions
   $ ./demo_extensions
or if on Windows,
   > gnatmake -p -P demo_extensions
   > demo_extensions

This should output the results of a simple set of tests.
[At some future release, we will list the expected output]

As a side-effect, it builds a static library for use in your own
programs.

In order to use this library within your own code, you need to use a
GPR referencing the extensions' GPR, "ada_math_build" [This name is
subject to change]. Either

* say 'with "ada_math_build";' and include
  /where/ever/gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD/src in your ADA_PROJECTS_PATH
  environment variable; or

* say 'with "/where/ever/gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD/src/ada_math_build";'
  (this path can be relative, if you like).

Testing
=======

Unit tests are based on AUnit
(http://svn.eu.adacore.com/anonsvn/US/trunk/AUnit). For instructions,
see test/aunit.gpr.
