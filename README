This is the README file for distributions of the Ada 2005 Math
Extensions project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnat-math-extn/)
on SourceForge.

The purpose of this project is to provide additional matrix
capabilities beyond those defined in the Standard Library (Annex G of
the ARM). The implementations, which are only for GNAT, are in the
form of bindings to the LAPACK and BLAS libraries which are widely
available if not already provided on all operating systems.

Prerequisites
=============

BLAS and LAPACK are required to be on the library lookup path (so that
the linker switches "-llapack -lblas" find them).

On Mac OS X, they are part of the vecLib framework.

Installation
============

The software unpacks into a directory structure of the form

gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD
   /src  contains the library code
   /test contains an installation verification program and unit tests.

Go to the test/ directory. If on a Unix-based system, run
   $ gnatmake -p -P demo_extensions
   $ ./demo_extensions
or if on Windows,
   > gnatmake -p -P demo_extensions
   > demo_extensions

This should output the results of a simple set of tests.
[At some future release, we will list the expected output]

As a side-effect, it builds a static library for use in your own
programs.

In order to use this library within your own code, you need to use a
GPR referencing the extensions' GPR, "gnat_math_extensions". Either

* say 'with "gnat_math_extensions";' and include
  /where/ever/gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD in your ADA_PROJECTS_PATH
  environment variable; or

* say 'with "/where/ever/gnat-math-extn-YYYYMMDD/gnat_math_extensions";'
  (this path can be relative, if you like).

Testing
=======

Unit tests are based on AUnit version 3 (part of GNAT GPL), which is
expected to be installed.
